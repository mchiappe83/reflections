This is a TO-DO list with the projects that are of my interest for 2019:

AI:
* Speech recognizer: Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. The model will convert raw audio into feature representations, which will then turn them into transcribed text.
* Facial Keypoint Detection: Use image processing techniques and deep learning to recognize faces and facial keypoints, such as the location of the eyes and mouth on a face.
* Automatic Image Captioning: Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a network that automatically produces captions, given an input image.
* Landmark Detection & Tracking: Use sensor data to localize a robot and build a map of the environment with SLAM.

AI for Trading:
* Trading with Momentum: Implement a momentum trading strategy and test if it has the potential to be profitable. You will work with historical data of a given stock universe and generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. You will then compute the signal and produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test to conclude if there is alpha in the signal
* Breakout Strategy: Code and evaluate a breakout signal. You will run statistical tests to test for normality and to find alpha. You will also learn about the effect that filtered outliers could have on your trading signal and identify if the outliers could be a valid trading signal. You will make a judgement call about what should be kept versus what should not.
* Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization: Create two portfolios using smart beta methodology and optimization. You will evaluate the performance of the portfolios by calculating tracking errors. You will also calculate the turnover of your portfolio and find the best timing to rebalance. You will come up with the portfolio weights by analyzing fundamental data and quadratic programming.
* Multi-factor Model: Research and generate multiple alpha factors. You will apply various techniques to evaluate the performance of your alpha factors and learn to pick the best ones for your portfolio. You will formulate an advanced portfolio optimization problem by working with constraints such as risk models, leverage, market neutrality, and limits on factor exposures.
* Sentiment Analysis using NLP: Work with corporate 10Q and 10K filings and apply your newly-learned knowledge in Natural Language Processing, from cleaning data and text processing, to feature extraction and modeling. You will use bag-of-words and TF-IDF to generate company-specific sentiments. Then you will come up with trading strategies, and measure the performance of your strategies.
* Deep Neural Network with News Data: Build deep neural networks to process and interpret news data. You will play with different ways of embedding words into vectors. You will construct and train LSTM networks for classifying sentiments. You will run backtests and apply the models to news data for signal generation.
* Backtesting: Construct an OHLC data feed and a backtesting framework. You will learn about various visualization techniques for backtesting. You will construct trading strategies using various parameters such as trade days, take profit levels, stop loss levels, etc. You will then optimize the parameters and evaluate the performance by analyzing the results of your backtests.
* Combine Signals for Enhanced Alpha: Create a model for S&P 500 and its constituent stocks by selecting a model for a large data set which includes market data, fundamental data and alternative data. You will validate your model to ensure there is no overfitting. You will rank and select stocks to construct a long/short portfolio based on the prediction results.

* Managing your Blockchain Identity: generate a private-public key pair and learn how to use it to securely authenticate your identity for the
transactions you post.
* Creating Your Own Private Blockchain: Fundamentals of architecting a collection of data into a blockchain data model. You'll configure how each block stores data, learn how blocks are validated in order to add new ones to the chain, and create methods to validate the chain integrity.
* Migrate Your Private Blockchain to Your API Web Service: Create a back end API web service and migrate your private blockchain to the web service you create. In the process
* Build Your Own Private Blockchain Notary Service: build a blockchain notary service API that can be used to secure digital assets. building out the back end infrastructure with a pre-developed front end.
* Build Your Own Notarization API with Ethereum Blockchain: build a smart contract, create a notary service, and deploy it on Ethereum blockchain.
* Architecture: addition of a relational database to include storage of raw data, metadata, transactional information, and indexing.
* Supply Chain & Data Auditing: modify your smart contract to support change of ownership, timestamp when this event occurs, and report auditing as required, as your notarized product moves through the supply chain
* build your own public blockchain project.
